## About the Game

Blackjack (also known as 21) is a popular card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. In this implementation:

- You play against the dealer.
- The game handles card shuffling, dealing, and value adjustments for Aces dynamically.

This project is written entirely in Python and utilizes basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it a great learning tool for Python enthusiasts.

Gameplay Rules
The dealer and the player are each dealt two cards. The dealer hides one card.
The player chooses to either:
Hit: Draw an additional card.
Stand: End their turn.
The dealer reveals their hidden card and continues to draw until their hand's value is 17 or higher.
The winner is determined as follows:
If the player exceeds 21, they lose (bust).
If the dealer exceeds 21, the player wins.
If both stay under 21, the higher hand value wins.
A tie results in a push (no winner).
Future Enhancements
Add betting functionality with virtual currency.
Support for multiple players.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
Implement save and load game history features.
Add sound effects for a richer gaming experience.
